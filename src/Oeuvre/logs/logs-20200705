2020-07-05 19:08:37.864 +05:30 [Warning] 'AddEntityFramework*' was called on the service provider, but 'UseInternalServiceProvider' wasn't called in the DbContext options configuration. Remove the 'AddEntityFramework*' call as in most cases it's not needed and might cause conflicts with other products and services registered in the same service provider.
